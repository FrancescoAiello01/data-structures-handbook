# My Data Structures Handbook

by Francesco Aiello

This is a summary of the data structures I have mastered throughout my studies at OSU-Cascades. Data structures are very important in creating efficient and effective software. The difference between using the right versus the wrong data structure in a given situation is vast, especially with big data. This handbook both serves as a reference for other developers and as a reference for employers to view the data structure knowledge I have developed.
